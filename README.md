# sundialonline
by Dieter Whittingham

## Purpose
Sun Dial is a full-stack web application that allows users to see the sunrise and sunset times anywhere in the world.\
The website also displays data such as first light, last light, and day length.\
Users can subscribe using their email to receive daily updates for a chosen location.

## Development
The frameworks and libraries used in this project are:\
React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, NodeMailer, Node Cron, and Tailwind CSS\
The APIs used in this project are sunrisesunset.io (sun data) and bigdatacloud.com (geolocation data)

## Release
I've purchased a domain for the website and I am finalizing the email hosting automation and front-end styling. The website should be available to the public very soon!
